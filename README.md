# 📊 Modeling U.S. Inflation Using Macroeconomic Indicators

**Author:** Ashwin Ramaseshan  
**Course:** STAT 404  

## Overview
This project analyzes U.S. inflation from **1991–2023** and examines how key macroeconomic indicators relate to inflation trends. The objective is to identify which variables best explain inflation behavior over time using both linear and nonlinear statistical models.

## Data
- Inflation rate (%)
- GDP growth (%)
- Interest rate (%)
- Unemployment rate (%)

Data were compiled from publicly available sources, including **Kaggle** and the **World Bank**.

## Methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear Regression
- Kernel Regression (LOESS)
- Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
- A custom **C implementation** integrated into R to compute a rolling average of inflation

## Key Findings
- Linear regression performed poorly and failed to capture the complexity of the data.
- Nonlinear methods (GAM and kernel regression) provided a substantially better fit.
- Unemployment rate showed the most consistent and interpretable relationship with inflation, supporting Phillips Curve–style dynamics.

## Files
- `code.r` – Main R analysis  
- `Inflation_Project_404_Final_Report.pdf` – Final report  
- CSV files – Macroeconomic datasets  
- `rolling_average.c` – C implementation for rolling average  

## Notes
This project was completed as part of **STAT 404** and focuses on modeling and interpretation rather than forecasting.
